# Protocols

How each device's battery level is read - one section per device, linked from the support table in
the [README](../README.md#supported-devices). These are the implementation notes: what is sent,
what comes back, and where each protocol was taken from.

## Headsets

### Astro A50 Gen 5 (Logitech 046D:0B1C)

**Connection:** Base station

The station's own vendor collection (usage page 0xFF32 / usage 0x0074): 64-byte reports, report id 0x02, `02 0c <len> 00 <cmd> <handle>`. Battery command 0x06 answers with the level in byte 6 and byte 8 set while the headset sits on the dock (charging). The protocol is HeadsetControl's, reverse-engineered from G HUB captures and verified on this USB id; it is neither HID++ nor the A50 X's Centurion protocol. **Unverified** - no A50 was on hand, so a level out of 0..100 is refused rather than shown

### Audeze Maxwell

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz dongle (3329:4B19) and USB-C cable (3329:4B1A)

The vendor collection (usage page 0xFF13): the sequence HeadsetControl uses, whose answer carries the battery as attribute 0x0CD6 (`05 5D <len> 00 D6 0C <percent>`). One packet is enough — the query for that attribute is answered with the marker on its own (0.19 s against 1.48 s for the whole sequence) — with the full sequence as the fallback. Dongle and cable are one headset and share one icon; charging is inferred from the cable answering, so the icon breathes while it sits on USB-C. With the headset switched off the dongle keeps answering with the last value it held, so the provider goes by the dongle's own product string — `"Audeze Maxwell Dongle"` with no headset linked, `"Audeze Maxwell HID"` with one — and reports nothing: the icon leaves the tray the way any switched-off device does

### Corsair Void v2 Wireless, Virtuoso Max Wireless, HS80 Max Wireless

**Connection:** Wireless receiver (1B1C:2A08, 1B1C:2A02, 1B1C:0A97)

The receiver's vendor collection on interface 4: 65-byte writes `00 02 <endpoint> 02 <cmd>`, endpoint 0x08 the receiver and 0x09 the headset, and 64-byte replies. After a minimal wake handshake (the one HeadsetControl uses, which avoids the pop of switching the headset into software mode), battery command 0x0F answers with a 16-bit value in hundredths of a percent at bytes 4-5. **Unverified** - no Corsair headset was on hand; the receiver sometimes answers with something other than a level, so that is retried and then refused rather than shown

### HyperX Cloud Alpha 2

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz station (03F0:08BE - the station's other function, 03F0:0ABE, is the audio-only "Chat" half and has nothing to read)

The battery collection is picked by usage page, 0xFF13:0xFF00. A 64-byte output report `50 02 00 00 ...` is answered by the input report starting `51 02`: the level is index 2 as a plain percentage, and bit 7 of index 6 was set after a recharge and clear before it, so it is shown as charging. Both were taken from two USBPcap captures of NGENUITY attached to issue #26, at 51 % and 67 %, and matched to the percentage NGENUITY displayed at the time; the `61 02` frame is byte-identical across the two states, so it is not the battery, and a level above 100 is refused rather than shown. **Confirmed on real hardware** by @azizen12 - the percentage was right on the station's first test. With NGENUITY running the station also emits thousands of `ff 01` / `44`-`45` housekeeping frames (its diagnostics showed the app reading only those); stale reports are therefore drained before the request and the reply is read until it arrives, so the two applications can run side by side - both states confirmed by @azizen12 on the final build. Credit for the captures: @azizen12.

### HyperX Cloud II Wireless

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz dongle (03F0:0696, and 03F0:018B on the newer dongle revision)

The vendor collection, picked by usage page rather than position (0xFF90:0x0303): the dongle carries four collections on the one interface, so the first one is not the right one. A 52-byte output report `06 ff bb <command> 00` is answered by 20 bytes echoing the command: command 0x02 carries the level in byte 7 (voltage in bytes 5-6), command 0x03 reports charging in byte 4 - the same exchange HeadsetControl uses for these two product ids. **Unverified** - no Cloud II Wireless was on hand, so a reply that does not echo the command is ignored and a level above 100 refused rather than shown

### HyperX Cloud III S Wireless

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz dongle (03F0:02CC, and 03F0:06BE which the reference also lists)

Another protocol again (LennardKittner/HyperHeadset's `cloud_iii_s_wireless`, and NGENUITY's USB traffic from HyperHeadset #36): a 64-byte *output* report `0c 02 03 01 00 <cmd>` (byte 3 = 01 only reads; the dongle ignores the same bytes as a feature report), command 0x06 for the battery and 0x48 for charging; the answer is input report 0x0C with the command in byte 5 and the value in byte 6 (0xFF = no value). The request goes to the collection that takes output report 0x0C, and all the dongle's collections are read for the answer. **Verified on hardware** in #106 (02CC): 89 %, the same level as NGENUITY; and in #156 (06BE), the level and the charging state

### HyperX Cloud III Wireless

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz dongle (03F0:05B7, and 03F0:0C9D which the reference also lists)

A different protocol from the Cloud II: the vendor collection is `0xFF13:0x0001`, a 62-byte `66 <command> 00 ...` packet goes out (0x66 is the report id) and 62 bytes come back whose second byte is either the command echo or the matching response id - `0x89`/`0x0D` carries the level in byte 4 (only when byte 2 or 3 is non-zero), `0x8A`/`0x0C` carries charging in byte 2 (0 not charging, 1 charging, 2 fully charged). Taken from LennardKittner/HyperHeadset, which lists this product id; that project also documents that some HyperX dongles accept these packets as **feature reports** only on Windows (`write()` fails with "Incorrect function" and the packet is retried with `send_feature_report`, which the diagnostics say either way). **Unverified on hardware** - no Cloud III Wireless was available here

### JBL Quantum 910 Wireless

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz dongle (0ECB:2088)

The receiver exposes one vendor collection, `ff13:0001` (interface 5 on a real unit), and the headset pushes its own reports there; there is no request to send. The battery arrives as report 0x08 with the level in byte 1 - the pattern plugato/JBL_Baterry_Monitor confirmed on this USB id - and report 0x2f is the microphone mute state. The headset can stay quiet for long stretches, so the last level heard is kept and shown greyed out until something arrives. **Confirmed on a real unit**: the provider finds the receiver, matches its collection and shows the level as soon as the headset reports. That report is an event - on the unit tested it arrives when the headset is plugged into its charger (a capture read 95% at the moment JBL's own app said 95%), and pressing the buttons or the volume rocker does not produce it - so the last level heard is kept and shown greyed out until the next one. The receiver also pushes a power report (0x09 - byte 1 is `0x00` when the headset is switched off and `0x01` when it is on, confirmed on a real unit - plus a 0x02 frame); none of them is a level, and a headset last seen switched off says so in the diagnostics rather than only "nothing heard"

### Logitech G PRO X 2 LIGHTSPEED

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz receiver (046D:0AF7)

Not HID++ on ff43: Logitech's "Centurion" transport on the vendor collection `ffa0:0001`, report 0x51. The app lists the receiver's features, reaches the headset through the receiver's bridge feature (0x0003), lists the headset's features and reads its battery feature 0x0104 (percent, charging state), all with read-only functions. From Solaar (tested on this headset) and HeadsetControl; firmware without 0x0104 gets HeadsetControl's fixed request. Confirmed on hardware in #103 (75 %, level and charging equal to G HUB)

### Razer Barracuda Pro (2.4 GHz)

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz dongle (1532:053a)

Its receiver publishes two collections and neither answers the standard Razer mouse request this app sends. The headset speaks the "PA" protocol instead: 64-byte vendor frames, `P`,`A` out and `P`,`I` back, battery command `0x21` with the level in the reply's data byte, charging `0x2A`. Decoded from a USBPcap capture of Razer Synapse on a real unit (it read 34%), then confirmed on hardware with @phl23's own Barracuda Pro: the level tracks (27% at the test), charging follows the charger, and a switched-off headset reports "no link" rather than a stale value. Over Bluetooth Windows reports the level itself.

### Razer BlackShark V2 Pro (2023)

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz receiver (1532:0555)

The headset's own "PA" protocol: output reports 0x02 on the vendor interface 0xFF00, remote mode 0xE1, commands 0x21 (battery) and 0x2A (charging)

### SteelSeries Arctis and GameBuds (other models)

**Connection:** wireless base station or dongle

The same `b0` exchanges as the Nova 7 above, applied to the other Arctis Nova 7 and Nova 5 family models; and the older Arctis 1, 7, 9, Pro Wireless, the Arctis 7+ (nine-step level) and the GameBuds (lower earbud level) exactly as HeadsetControl documents their requests. The Nova Pro Wireless stations (`1038:12E0`, `1038:12E5`) are handled too. The models in the support table above are the confirmed ones.

### SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz dongle (1038:22A1)

Output report `00 b0` on interface 3 (usage page 0xFFC0); the reply carries the level and the status (off / charging / on battery), as documented by HeadsetControl. Works alongside SteelSeries GG. The other Nova 7 variants and the Nova 5 / 5X use the same request and are included, but not tested

### SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite

**Connection:** Wireless base station, interface 3 (`1038:2244`)

A read-only status request `01 b0` (a 64-byte output report, report id `01`) goes to the vendor collection of interface 3 that takes it (`0xFFC0` first; the other one refuses the report id); the station answers with a direct `01 b0` reply (headset level in byte 6, power state in byte 14, charging in byte 15, the layout loteran/Arctis-Sound-Manager takes from SteelSeries GG's own description of the station) or with `07` frames, which can arrive on the other collection, so both are read. `07 b7` carries the headset level in byte 2 and charging in byte 4 (`02` charging, `08` on battery); `07 b5` carries the power state in byte 4 (`01` off, `02` cable charging, `04` standby, `08` online). A headset reported as off (power code `01`) shows nothing, and the spare battery level in byte 3 is not shown. A `07 b7` that the station sends by itself is read as well. Exchange from elegos/Linux-Arctis-Manager (made from a USB capture of SteelSeries GG on Windows), the same in loteran/Arctis-Sound-Manager. **Level and charging verified on hardware** in #138: the level matches SteelSeries GG (31 % at the first test, from the direct reply) and the charging animation follows the charger (build 1.12.0.7). A switched-off headset shows 0 %, as SteelSeries GG also does in its tray: on this station the off state does not arrive as power code `01`, so this is parity with the vendor rather than a gap. A level above 100 is refused rather than shown. The other ids of this station (`2246`, `2249`, `2270`) are not included yet

### SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Omni

**Connection:** GameHub base station (1038:2290), switch on USB-1

Output report `01 b0` (report id 1) on the vendor collection of interface 3; the reply `01 b0 ...` carries the headset level in byte 6 and the level of the spare battery charging in the base station in byte 7 (both 0-100), the radio link in byte 14 (`08` = connected) and the charging state in byte 15 (`02` = charging). The spare battery is shown in the tooltip next to the headset, e.g. "Arctis Nova Pro Omni: 75%, spare battery 50%". The events the base station pushes on its own (`07 ...`) are skipped. Layout from [loteran/Arctis-Sound-Manager](https://github.com/loteran/Arctis-Sound-Manager), which checked it against a capture of SteelSeries GG. The base station only answers with its switch on USB-1: on USB-2 (1038:2292) or XBOX (1038:2293) nothing can be read, and the diagnostics say so. **Unverified** - no Omni was on hand, so a level above 100 is refused rather than shown

### SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless (`1038:12E0`, `1038:12E5` X)

**Connection:** Wireless base station, interface 3 or 4

The same `b0` exchange as the other Nova headsets, asked for with report id `06` instead of `00`, as HeadsetControl asks for these base stations: the level is a nine-step code in byte 6 (shown as "about NN%") and the state in byte 15 (`01` off / out of range, `02` cable charging, `08` on battery). A reply with any other state byte, a level code above 8 or fewer than 16 bytes is refused rather than shown. The request goes only to a vendor collection of these two ids; the diagnostics in #41 show `1038:12e5` exposing `ffc0:0001` on interface 4 (plus a second vendor collection `ff00:0001` there), so both are tried and the answering one is remembered. The reply layout is HeadsetControl's - not yet seen on hardware here

## Mice

### AM Infinity 8K (Angry Miao)

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz receiver (3151:5007)

The AJAZZ Control Center project's AJ-series exchange: a zero-payload `0xF7` status poll brings the receiver's 2.4G telemetry up, then the charge reads from status report `0x05` (`05 00 00 64 01 01 01 02`, charge at byte 3 on Windows). A zero charge or junk bytes are shown as no level rather than a wrong value, and no charging state is reported. **Unverified** - no AM Infinity was on hand; the exchange is confirmed on the reference project's own unit, so the layout stands until the reporter of #72 confirms it

### ASUS ROG Gladius III Aimpoint and other ROG / TUF wireless mice

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz receiver or USB cable (for example 0B05:1A72)

The battery command G-Helper uses: output report 0 `12 07` (65 bytes) on the vendor collection of interface 0, answered by a report echoing `12 07` with the battery in byte 5 (a percentage, or a level 0-4 on older models such as the Chakram and Keris Wireless) and charging in byte 10. 0 without charging is standby, not empty, so it shows nothing; `ff aa` (command not known) and an all-zero reply are not read as a level. Receiver and cable share one icon. The OMNI receiver and models with other layouts are not included. **Unverified** - no ASUS mouse was on hand

### Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz dongle (1B1C:1B7F)

The Dark Core / Ironclaw "nxp" protocol from ckb-next: a 64-byte packet `CMD_GET 0x0e` + `FIELD_BATTERY 0x50` answered with a level index into the five-step table {0, 15, 30, 50, 100}, so the level is shown as a gauge ("about 50%") and no charging state is reported. The wired id 1B1C:1B7E is left out. **Unverified** - no Corsair mouse was on hand; the collection (`ff42:0001`) comes from the reporter's dump in #56

### Finalmouse UltralightX (ULX)

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz dongle (361D:0100)

The protocol of Finalmouse's own web configurator, XPanel: output report 04 `<length> <0x80 | command> <payload length>` on the dongle's vendor collection (usage page 0xFF00), answered by input report 05. Command 36 is the link state (0 = the mouse is not connected), 38 the battery (state of charge in percent, then the voltage), 37 charging; firmware that does not answer 38 is read through command 5, the voltage, with XPanel's discharge curve. A mouse that is off or asleep keeps its last level on a greyed icon for 5 minutes. On its USB cable (361D:0102) the mouse only takes firmware updates, so it is read through the dongle. **Unverified** - no ULX was on hand; the framing matches the settings writes captured by [johnklucinec/ulx_reverse](https://github.com/johnklucinec/ulx_reverse)

### G-Wolves HSK Pro ACE and the other models with a receiver of their own

**Connection:** the model's own receiver (e.g. 33E4:5803 for the HSK Pro ACE, #105) or USB cable

HSK Pro / Plus / Lite, HSK Plus ACE, HTX, HTX ACE, HTX Mini, HTS Plus, HTS Plus ACE, HTS Ultra, HTR, HTR Pro, HT-S2, HT-S2 Pro, Fenrir, Fenrir Max, VUK; HTM Plus, HSK Pro 2.0, HTXU, Fenrir Pro. The ids and the exchange per model come from G-Wolves' web driver list (mouse.xyz, `Config/env-models.json`). Models with "IsNewProtocol" 0 use the web driver's getOldBattery: feature report `00 02 8f 01` (00 on the cable), reply `a1 02 8f .. <charging> <battery %>`; the others use the exchange of the 8K receiver below. Same 64-byte feature report collection; receiver and cable of one model share an icon. **Unverified** - no such mouse was on hand

### G-Wolves WARG, HTS Plus (Pro), HTXU, Lycan, Fenrir Pro / Asym, HTX Mini

**Connection:** 8K receiver or USB cable

The same feature report exchange as the WLmouse mice (`00 00 02 02 00 83` out, `a1 ... 83 <charging> <battery%>` back), which G-Wolves' web driver mouse.xyz uses for every mouse on this receiver. The request goes only to the collection that Windows reports with a 64-byte feature report (HidP_GetCaps), as the web driver chooses it. A sleeping mouse keeps its last value on a greyed icon. **Unverified** - no G-Wolves mouse was on hand

### Hitscan Hyperlight

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz receiver (3770:0200) or USB cable (3770:0100)

The same 17-byte frames as the Pulsar / ATK / VXE row, on the vendor collection `ff02:0002`: [sopparus/hitscan-battery](https://github.com/sopparus/hitscan-battery) mapped them from USB captures of Hitscan Utility 1.0.2 (command 0x04, level in byte 6, charging in byte 7, millivolts in bytes 8-9) and reads them on Linux. Note the vendor application's own battery indicator is broken - it showed 100 % while the device answered 75 - so the raw byte is the truth. **Unverified** here: no Hyperlight was on hand, [so #105's reporter confirming the level](https://github.com/HeyOkay/HaloBattery/issues/105) would settle it

### LAMZU Maya X

**Connection:** 8K dongle (373E:001E) or USB cable (373E:001C)

The same feature report exchange as the WLmouse and G-Wolves mice (`00 00 02 02 00 83` out, `a1 00 02 02 00 83 <charging> <battery %>` back), on the vendor collection `ffff:0000` of interface 2 only; protocol from Sheroune/lamzu-battery-monitory (MIT). Confirmed on a Maya X on its 8K dongle

### MCHOSE A7 V2 Ultra

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz receiver (3837:100B, RealTek strings)

The same protocol as the M7 Ultra on MCHOSE's newer vendor id, which the reference driver treats identically: the diagnostics in [#4](https://github.com/HeyOkay/HaloBattery/issues/4) show the same interface shape (collections 0xFF0B:0x104 and 0xFF01:0x01 on interface 2). The status read is documented on the shorter 0x11 report, so both report ids are tried, and the mouse is named from the receiver's own product string. Icon of its own, so it and an M7 Ultra stay two devices. **Unverified** — no A7 V2 Ultra was on hand, so a level out of range is refused rather than shown

### MCHOSE G7

**Connection:** USB (A8A5:2255, chip 'YJX-CHIP')

A different chip from the M7 Ultra, and a different protocol: a 65-byte output report `00 55 30 A5 0B 2E 01 01 01`, answered by an input report starting `AA 30` whose byte 8 is the level and byte 9 the charging flag. Written from @kek353's own monitor and the device dump in [#8](https://github.com/HeyOkay/HaloBattery/issues/8); only its 0xFF01 vendor collection is written to. Confirmed on @kek353's G7, which answers `aa 30 a5 0b 0a 01 01 01 2e 00 00 00` — 46%, not charging, the same level their own tool shows — and again on its cable (`aa 30 a5 3c 0a 01 01 01 2e 01 00 00`, byte 9 = 1 while charging) with the PID unchanged, so a G7 keeps one icon on the dongle or on the cable. Only the `AA 30` header is relied on: byte 3 differs between the two (`0x0b` against `0x3c`). A level out of range is refused rather than shown

### MCHOSE M7 Ultra

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz receiver (5253:1020)

The vendor collection (usage page 0xFF01; the sibling 0xFF0B never answers): feature report 0x11 (the shorter report, tried first) or 0x12 with command 0x06, every payload byte inverted, which returns `53 52 31 00 02 05 07 00 09 64 00 64` — vid 0x5253, model 0x31, firmware, flags, then the level and the charging byte (1 while charging). The request has to be repeated for each read, and the receiver only relays a real value while the mouse is awake: asleep it answers with zeros, so a silent mouse keeps its last level on a greyed icon. On the cable the mouse answers on its own PID (5253:0031, the number it reports as its model id) and the receiver goes quiet: both connections share one icon, and whichever one reports charging wins

### Pulsar X2 V2 Mini, ATK VXE R1 SE+, VXE R1 Pro Max

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz dongle (3554:F508, 373B:1085, 3554:F58A) and USB cable (3554:F507, 3554:F58F, 3554:F58C)

17-byte big-endian frames, report id 0x08: command 0x04 asks for the power details and answers with the level in byte 6, the on-cable flag in byte 7 and millivolts in bytes 8-9, with a checksum (0x55 minus the sum of the first 16 bytes) in byte 16. From andrewrabert/python-pulsar-mouse-tool, which also backs the "HID: pulsar" driver in review for Linux; the Kysona M600 and VXE Dragonfly R1 Pro use the same protocol but their ids are not claimed here. The ATK/VXE control panel of the OpenMouse project (@openmouse/protocol, drivers/atk) lists the R1 Pro Max receiver as 3554:f58a and reads it with the same command 0x04 frame, opening the collection with usage page 0xFF02 and usage 0x0002 - the R1 Pro Max dongle has five other interface-1 collections and the first of them is not the one that answers, so that collection is now preferred; a collection whose output report cannot carry the 17-byte frame is skipped, because Windows refuses that write and the refusal looks exactly like a device that is switched off. The framing is also in G-Wolves' own web driver (mouse.xyz), whose Compx class sends the same report-0x08 frame with a checksum of 0x55 minus the sum of the payload. The R1 Pro Max is confirmed on hardware on both of its transports, by the reporter of #87: this provider read the mouse on its stock 1 kHz receiver, on the `ff02:0002` collection, and on its cable the level agreed with ATK's own panel (hub.atk.pro) with the charging flag following the cable in both directions, so the cable id (3554:F58C) is read on hardware as well rather than only claimed from their report. A frame whose checksum does not match is refused rather than shown

### Razer Basilisk V3 Pro, Razer Basilisk Ultimate

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz receiver

The standard Razer 90-byte feature report, as used by Synapse and OpenRazer: power class 0x07, commands 0x80 (battery) and 0x84 (charging)

### Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz receiver (1532:00BF)

Same mice protocol: transaction id 0x1F, command class 0x07, command 0x80 answers `02 1f 00 00 00 02 07 80 00 ab`, and raw 0xAB = 171/255 = 67%, stable across polls and unchanged while Synapse runs. Idle, the mouse answers status 04 and keeps its last level on a greyed icon

### Razer wireless mice (other OpenRazer models)

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz receiver or USB cable

The same exchange as the Razer mice above: the 90-byte feature report, command class `0x07`, command `0x80`, transaction ids from OpenRazer's device entries. Pro Click, Pro Click V2 and V2 Vertical, Naga, Viper, DeathAdder, Basilisk, Mamba, Lancehead and others - `KNOWN` in `providers/razer.py` holds the full list. Battery is only read for the models OpenRazer itself reads.

### SteelSeries Aerox 3 Wireless

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz dongle (1038:1838)

The receiver's battery query: it flags its configuration opcodes with `0x40` over their wired values, so the wired `92` stays silent and a 64-byte `00 d2 ...` is answered by a report echoing `d2`. The level byte is the charging flag in bit 7 plus a 1..21 step value (or a direct percentage above 21), as yurtemre7/steel-mouse decodes it; the interface and the product id come from alloyctl's reverse engineering of this exact id, cross-checked against the capture notes at gort818/aerox3-wireless. A level byte of 0 means off or asleep rather than empty, and the 2.4 GHz link sleeps when the mouse is idle - it wakes on the next movement, so a poll that lands on a sleeping mouse simply shows nothing. Works alongside SteelSeries GG; the CS2 Dragon Lore edition (1038:1878) shares the protocol and is included untested The Aerox 5 Wireless (1038:1852, 185C, 1860) and Aerox 9 Wireless (1038:1858, 1874) in 2.4 GHz mode use the same battery exchange in rivalcfg (`0x92` with the wireless flag `0x40`, level `(value - 1) * 5`); the level is confirmed on an Aerox 9 Wireless by @AJD00m in #79 (`d2 04 ...` = 15 %, the same as SteelSeries GG), the charging bit is not tested yet

### SteelSeries Rival 3 Wireless

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz dongle (1038:1830)

The mouse exchange on the same interface and the same `0xFFC0` configuration collection as the headsets, but not the `b0` request: a 64-byte `00 aa 01 ...` out, answered by a report carrying the level. The two references disagree about the reply and neither has been on hardware here, so both shapes are read: a reply that echoes `aa` (level in byte 1, charging in byte 3, as yurtemre7/steel-mouse reads it) and a 3-byte reply read the way flozz/rivalcfg does (level in byte 0, charging in byte 2, the same request and the same hidapi read). A leading report id byte of `0x00` is skipped, a level above 100 is refused in both shapes, and in the 3-byte shape the charging byte has to be 0 or 1 so a stray report cannot pass as a level - the diagnostics print the raw reply and say which shape was used. The collection is picked by usage page `0xFFC0` rather than by interface number, because the Rival 650 has it on interface 0 (rivalcfg issue #202). Works alongside SteelSeries GG; the Gen 2 revision (1038:1872) is included untested

### WLmouse Beast X and Beast X Mini Pro

**Connection:** 8K or 1K receiver, or USB cable

The same feature-report exchange as the Beast X Max (`00 00 02 02 00 83` out, `a1 00 02 02 00 83 <charging> <battery %>` back), on the vendor collection `ffff:0000`. The provider's receiver table lists `0xA887` (Beast X) and `0xA868` (Beast X Mini Pro); the Max is confirmed, these two are not.

### WLmouse Beast X Max

**Connection:** 8K receiver (36A7:A880) and USB cable

Feature request `02 02 00 83`; if there is no reply, the mouse heartbeat is used. Receiver and cable share one icon

## Mice and keyboards

### Keychron Ultra-Link 8K, Keychron M5

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz receiver (3434:D028) and USB cable (3434:D048)

Keychron's vendor protocol on interface 4: a 64-byte feature report `b3 06` (status), answered by a 64-byte input report `b4 06` whose byte 20 is the level, retried up to three times. From csutcliff/keychron-battery-dkms, which implements it for these two ids. **Unverified** - no Keychron device was on hand, so a level above 100 is refused rather than shown

### Lofree Hyzen

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz dongle (388D:0025)

The transaction Lofree's own web driver (hyzen.lofree.tech) uses, on report 0x04 of the vendor collection 0xFF1C:0x92: start (`00 00 01`), the command, end (`00 00 02`), each acknowledged in byte 2. Command `AA` asks if the keyboard is online, command `1A` returns the level in byte 7. As in the web driver, only the dongle is read, and not while the same keyboard is on its cable; no charging state. **Unverified** - no Lofree keyboard was on hand

### Logitech G502 LIGHTSPEED, G502 X PLUS

**Connection:** Lightspeed receiver (046D:C539, 046D:C547)

HID++ 2.0 on the receiver's vendor interface: the device name (feature 0x0005) and the first battery feature the device supports (0x1004 unified battery, 0x1000 battery status or 0x1001 battery voltage; the G502 LIGHTSPEED reports voltage, converted to % with the Li-ion curve used by Solaar, the G502 X PLUS the unified battery percentage). The icon follows the device's unit id (feature 0x0003). Works alongside G HUB

### Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz receiver (1532:025C), cable (1532:025A)

The standard Razer commands: class `0x07` id `0x80` for the level (0-255, shown as a percentage) and id `0x84` for charging. The keyboard answers on its own control collection, not a `ff00` vendor page - the probe order's ranking is a preference, not a filter, so it reaches any collection that answers. From OpenRazer's keyboard driver: `razer_attr_read_charge_level()` reads the wireless id with transaction id `0x9F` and the wired id with `0x3F`, and `razer_get_report_params()` puts both on USB interface 2. **Unverified** - no Razer keyboard was on hand; the diagnostics name every interface/usage they try, so a dump from the reporter of #56 settles it

### Razer DeathStalker V2 Pro TKL

**Connection:** HyperSpeed receiver (1532:0296) or USB cable (1532:0298)

The standard Razer commands (class `0x07` id `0x80` for the level, 0-255 shown as a percentage, and id `0x84` for charging) with OpenRazer's keyboard-driver values: transaction id `0x9F` on the receiver on USB interface 2, `0x1F` on the cable on interface 3 (`razer_attr_read_charge_level()` and `razer_get_report_params()`). That interface is asked first, the others stay a fallback. The receiver's product string is " DSV2Pro TKL", without a wireless word, so the PID is listed in `KNOWN` and always polled. The icon shows the keyboard pictogram. Confirmed on hardware over the receiver (#106)

### Razer DeathStalker V2 Pro, BlackWidow V3 Mini, V4 Mini and V4 Tenkeyless HyperSpeed

**Connection:** HyperSpeed receiver or USB cable

The same exchange as the DeathStalker V2 Pro TKL above, with the ids and interfaces from OpenRazer's keyboard driver: DeathStalker V2 Pro 1532:0290 (receiver, `0x9F`, interface 2) and 1532:0292 (cable, `0x1F`, interface 3); BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed 1532:0271 / 0258 and BlackWidow V4 Mini HyperSpeed 1532:02BA / 02B9 (`0x9F` / `0x1F`, both on interface 3); BlackWidow V4 Tenkeyless HyperSpeed 1532:02D5 (receiver, `0x9F`, interface 2) and 1532:02D7 (cable, `0x1F`, interface 3). **Unverified** - only the DeathStalker V2 Pro TKL has been tested on hardware so far

## Controllers

### 8BitDo Pro 2, Pro 3, SN30 Pro, SF30 Pro in D-input mode

**Connection:** Bluetooth (2DC8:6006 and the other ids in `providers/eightbitdo.py`) or USB

Listened to, never written: byte 14 of the controller's enhanced input report (report 0x01 over Bluetooth, 0x04 over USB; bits 0-6 the level in %, bit 7 charging), as SDL reads it. The controller sends that report only after Steam or a game has switched it on, see the note below the table. In XInput mode these controllers are read as Xbox controllers. **Unverified** - no 8BitDo controller was on hand, so a level of 0 or above 100 is refused rather than shown

### GameSir G7 Pro; FlyDigi Vader Pro

**Connection:** 2.4 GHz receiver (shows up as an Xbox controller)

Windows.Gaming.Input battery report: exact percentage and charging state. XInput is the fallback (four levels only)

### Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, Joy-Con (L) / (R)

**Connection:** Bluetooth (057E:2009, 2006, 2007)

Byte 2 of the controller's own input report: level 0-8 in steps of 2 (full, medium, low, critical, empty) and the charging bit, shown as SDL shows it (level / 8, so 100 / 75 / 50 / 25 / 0 %) with the level name in the tooltip. When Steam has put the controller in the full mode, the 0x30 reports carry the byte and nothing is written; otherwise one read-only subcommand (0x02, request device info) is sent and its 0x21 reply carries the byte. The controller mode is never changed. USB is not read (the controller charges there). **Unverified** - no Switch controller was on hand, so a level above 8 is refused rather than shown

### Sony DualSense (PS5)

**Connection:** USB or Bluetooth

Read straight from the HID input report (USB byte 53, Bluetooth full report byte 54). Over Bluetooth, see the note below the table

### Sony DualShock 4 (PS4)

**Connection:** USB cable and Bluetooth (054C:09CC)

Read straight from the HID input report: exact percentage and charging state (USB byte 30, Bluetooth full report byte 32). Over Bluetooth, see the note below the table

### Xbox-compatible controllers (other models)

**Connection:** USB or the Xbox wireless adapter

Any Xbox-compatible controller is read the same way as the GameSir G7 Pro: the battery level from `Windows.Gaming.Input.RawGameControllers`, with XInput's coarse level (low / medium / full) as the fallback. Controllers other than the GameSir have not been individually tested.

## Bluetooth

### Bluetooth devices, tested on the 1MORE SonoFlow headset

**Connection:** Bluetooth (on by default, can be turned off in the menu)

The level Windows itself knows (`DEVPKEY_Bluetooth_Battery`). Only devices connected right now are shown: the link state comes from WinRT (`BluetoothDevice.ConnectionStatus`, the same source as Windows Settings). A device that is also read over HID keeps one icon: the HID reading wins and the Bluetooth copy is dropped

## Others

### Logitech (more HID++ 2.0 devices and G-series headsets)

**Connection:** Lightspeed, Unifying or Bolt receiver

The provider reads HID++ 2.0 generically from the receiver's `ff00` vendor collections (slots 1-6), so most other HID++ 2.0 mice and keyboards on a Lightspeed, Unifying or Bolt receiver should answer the same `0x1004` unified battery request. The G-series headsets - G533, G535, G633, G635, G733, G933, G935, G PRO, G PRO X - are in the headset pid table and use feature `0x1F20` (the G535 on its consumer collection). Only the models listed in the support table above are confirmed so far.
