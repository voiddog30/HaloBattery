"""PlayStation controllers: DualShock 4 (PS4) and DualSense / DualSense Edge (PS5).

These connect straight to the PC over USB or Bluetooth, not through XInput, so
Windows' XInput / Windows.Gaming.Input battery APIs never report them. The
battery level is read directly from the controller's HID input report, the same
source the Linux hid-sony / hid-playstation drivers and DS4Windows use.

  * USB: the controller streams its full input report immediately.
      DualShock 4  report id 0x01: battery in byte 30
                   (low nibble = level 0..10, bit 4 = cable connected / charging)
      DualSense    report id 0x01: status  in byte 53
                   (low nibble = level 0..10, high nibble = charging state)
  * Bluetooth: the controller only sends a minimal report (id 0x01, ~10 bytes,
    no battery) until the host reads a feature report (DS4 0x02, DualSense 0x05);
    after that it streams the full report, shifted by a couple of header bytes:
      DualShock 4  report id 0x11: battery in byte 32
      DualSense    report id 0x31: status  in byte 54

Over USB the feature report is harmless. Over Bluetooth it is NOT: the switch to
the full report stays on until the controller is turned off, and in that mode games
and launchers that read the controller through DirectInput stop seeing its input
(issue #96; SDL documents the same for its own "enhanced" mode, and #101 shows it on
the 8BitDo Pro 2 too). So over Bluetooth the app only listens by default: when Steam
or a game has already switched the controller to the full report, the battery is
read from it; otherwise the icon shows the controller without a level. The switch is
sent over Bluetooth only when the user turns on "PlayStation over Bluetooth: full
mode" in Preferences (`switch_bluetooth`).
