"""Nintendo Switch controllers over Bluetooth: Pro Controller and Joy-Con.

Windows does not know their battery level, so it is read from the controller's
own input reports. Source: SDL's HIDAPI Switch driver
(src/joystick/hidapi/SDL_hidapi_switch.c) and dekuNukem's
Nintendo_Switch_Reverse_Engineering notes.

  * Input reports 0x21 (the reply to a subcommand), 0x30 and 0x31 (full reports)
    start with the same header:
        [0] report id   [1] timer   [2] battery and connection
    The high nibble of byte 2 is the battery:
        bits 7..5  level 0..8, in steps of 2 (8 full, 6 medium, 4 low,
                   2 critical, 0 empty)
        bit 4      charging
    SDL shows level / 8 as the percentage (100, 75, 50, 25, 0). This provider
    does the same, and the tooltip shows the level name.
  * Report 0x3F (the "simple" mode the controller starts in over Bluetooth)
    has no battery.

What the provider sends. Over Bluetooth, the controller is in the simple mode
until an app changes it. The provider does not change the mode. It first
listens: when Steam or another app has put the controller in the full mode, the
0x30 reports carry the battery and nothing is written. Otherwise it sends one
subcommand that only reads information: 0x02 "request device info". The
controller answers with report 0x21, and the header of that report carries the
battery. The output report is 0x01 (rumble and subcommand), 49 bytes, with the
neutral rumble data SDL uses (00 01 40 40), so the controller does not vibrate.

USB is not read. On the cable the controller charges, and the USB protocol needs
a handshake (0x80 0x02) that changes the controller's USB state.
