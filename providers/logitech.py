"""Logitech wireless mice, keyboards and headsets over HID++ 2.0. Works alongside G HUB.

HID++ is Logitech's own protocol. Logitech documents it and Solaar implements it.

Where the app finds a device:
  * Receivers (Lightspeed, Unifying, Bolt, Nano): the vendor collections ff00:0001
    ("short" reports, 7 bytes) and ff00:0002 ("long" reports, 20 bytes). The devices
    paired to the receiver are in slots 1..6.
  * A mouse or keyboard on its USB cable: the same two collections, slot 0xFF.
  * Headsets: only a long collection, slot 0xFF. It is ff43:0202 for most models;
    the G535 puts it on its consumer collection 000c:0001 (HeadsetControl).

How the app talks to a device:
  * request:  11 <slot> <feature index> <function << 4 | swid> <params...>
  * the root feature (index 0): function 0 finds the index of a feature,
    function 1 is a "ping" (is a device in this slot?)
  * error reply:  10 <slot> 8f <feature index> <function|swid> <error code> ...
                  11 <slot> ff <feature index> <function|swid> <error code> ...
    error code 0x08: the slot is empty
    error code 0x09 / 0x04: a device is paired, but it is off or out of range
    error code 0x01: the device speaks the older HID++ 1.0 (not read yet)
  * a paired device that is asleep does not answer at all

Features the app reads (the first battery feature that the device has):
  * 0x1004 unified battery, fn 1: <percent> <level flags> <status> ...
  * 0x1000 battery status,  fn 0: <percent> <next level> <status>
      status for both: 0 discharging, 1 charging, 2 almost full, 3 full,
      4 slow charging (Solaar's BatteryStatus)
  * 0x1001 battery voltage, fn 0: <mV hi> <mV lo> <flags>, flags bit 7 = charging
  * 0x1F20 ADC measurement (headsets), fn 0: <mV hi> <mV lo> <flags>,
      flags bit 0 = headset connected, bit 1 = charging. An error reply means the
      headset is connected but inactive.
  * 0x0005 device name (fn 0 length, fn 1 characters, fn 2 device type)
  * 0x0003 device information, fn 0: <entities> <unit id: 4 bytes> ...

    hidapi reports an empty one for the collections Windows re-parents, which would make
    two receivers look identical again.

    The last `&`-separated part of that segment is the *collection* number, and it has to
    go. One interface hands out `...&0&0000` for its first collection and `...&0&0001` for
    the next, which is exactly how a receiver's two HID++ collections differ (`Col01` ends
    in `&0000`, `Col02` in `&0001`). Keeping it split one receiver into two groups: the
    group holding only the long collection was polled without the short one, so the empty
    slots' error replies could not be read, every slot burnt its full timeout, and each was
    then pinged with the short timeout for the rest of the session. What remains after
    dropping the collection number comes from the interface itself, so two receivers still
    get different keys.
