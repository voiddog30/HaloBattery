"""Xbox-compatible controllers (GameSir G7 Pro, Xbox Wireless Controller and
other controllers that speak the Xbox protocol).

Two sources, best first:
  1. Windows.Gaming.Input battery report (see wgi.py): a real percentage and
     the charging state. Works for controllers that never report through XInput.
  2. XInputGetBatteryInformation: only four levels (empty / low / medium / full),
     so the ring shows an approximate level and the tooltip says so.

    XINPUT_BATTERY_INFORMATION { BYTE BatteryType; BYTE BatteryLevel; }
    BatteryType:  0x00 disconnected, 0x01 wired, 0x02 alkaline, 0x03 NiMH, 0xFF unknown
    BatteryLevel: 0 empty, 1 low, 2 medium, 3 full

XInput also tells which controllers are connected at all, cheaply enough to
check every couple of seconds.
