"""8BitDo controllers in their own (D-input) mode: Pro 2, Pro 3, SN30 Pro, SF30 Pro.

In XInput mode these controllers show up as an Xbox controller and the XInput
provider already reads them. In D-input mode (vendor 2DC8) they are plain HID
gamepads, and the battery level is only in the controller's "enhanced" input
report, the one SDL (and so Steam) switches on:

  * SDL reads feature report 0x06 once; after that the controller streams its
    enhanced report: id 0x01 over Bluetooth, id 0x04 over USB.
  * byte 14 of that report: bits 0-6 = level in %, bit 7 = charging.

Switching is NOT harmless (issue #101): the reporter tested it on a Pro 2 over
Bluetooth and after Steam had switched the controller, DirectInput games saw no
input until the controller was turned off. The same thing happens with PlayStation
controllers (#96). So this provider never sends the feature report. It only
listens: when Steam or a game has already switched the controller, the level is
read from the enhanced report; otherwise the icon shows the controller without a
level.

Telling the two reports apart: over Bluetooth the controller's ordinary report
may carry the same id 0x01, and on Windows hidapi pads every report with zeros to
the longest input report of the collection. So a report only counts when byte 14
holds a real level (1..100 %). A zero there is the padding of the ordinary
report, not an empty battery: the controller is running, and taking it as 0 %
would raise a false low-battery alert. The first bytes of what arrived go to the
diagnostics, so a report from a user can confirm the layout.
