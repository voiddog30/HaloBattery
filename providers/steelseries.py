"""SteelSeries wireless headsets (Arctis Nova 7 and Nova 5 families), directly
over USB/HID, without SteelSeries GG. Works alongside GG.

Protocol (model list and reply layouts as documented by Sapd/HeadsetControl):
  * output report 00 b0 on interface 3 (usage page 0xFFC0) of the dongle
  * Nova 7 reply:  b0 <link> <battery> <status> ...
      link 03 = headset connected, 02 = not connected (Linux driver; seen on a 22A1:
      while the headset is off or still switching on, the dongle repeats the last
      battery value, and only the link byte shows it)
      battery 0..100, or 0..4 on the original firmware
      status 00 = headset off / out of range, 01 / 02 = charging, 03 = on battery
  * Nova 5 / Nova 3P reply:  b0 <status> <?> <battery 0..100> <charging> ...
      status 02 = headset off / out of range, charging 01 = charging
  * Arctis 7+ reply:  b0 <status> <battery 0..4> <charging> ...
      status 01 = headset off, charging 01 = charging
  * GameBuds reply:  b0 <?> <?> <left status> <right status> <left %> <right %> ...
      status 03 = bud out of the case; a bud in the case reports 0 %, so it is ignored
  * other reports can arrive on the same interface; the b0 reply is picked out, and the
   parsers insist on it, so anything else the dongle sends yields no reading at all
   (without that check a stray report reads as a level: `01 00 63 02` as 99%)

Mouse battery (Rival 3 Wireless and family), from yurtemre7/steel-mouse:
  * same interface 3 and the same ffc0 collection, but a different exchange:
    a 64-byte request 00 aa 01 ... and a reply that echoes the command: aa <level> ...
  * a report on that interface which does not carry the aa echo is skipped, as
    steel-mouse does (they used to read as a fixed 85% / 100%)
  * steel-mouse accepts a reply with the aa echo present, while its decoder and unit
    tests read the level with no echo at all. The offsets here follow the echo, so
    they are not confirmed on hardware: a level above 100 is refused rather than
    shown, and the raw reply is logged, so a probe settles the layout
  * SteelSeries GG reads the same collection, so both can run side by side

Nova Pro Wireless base stations (1038:12E0, and the X station at 1038:12E5), from the
same HeadsetControl source:
  * the b0 exchange once more, but asked for with report id 06 (06 b0), and HeadsetControl
    reads it on interface 4 - so interface 3 and interface 4 are both accepted for these
    two ids
  * reply: a nine-step level code in byte 6 (map(code, 0, 8, 0, 100) = 0, 12, 25, 37, 50,
    62, 75, 87, 100) and the headset state in byte 15: 01 = headset off / out of range,
    02 = charging on the cable, 08 = on battery. The reply does not echo the request, so
    only those three state bytes are accepted - anything else is not the battery answer -
    and a reply shorter than 16 bytes or a level code above 8 is refused rather than shown
  * nine steps are not a percentage, so the tray shows "about NN%" for these

Older Arctis headsets (Arctis 1, 7, 9, Pro Wireless) use other requests on other
interfaces: see CLASSIC_MODELS further down.

Aerox 3 Wireless (and the CS2 Dragon Lore edition, which shares the protocol) from
alloyctl's reverse engineering of 1038:1838 on real hardware, cross-checked against
steel-mouse and the capture notes at gort818/aerox3-wireless:
  * same interface 3 and the same ffc0 collection, 64-byte reports
  * the receiver flags its configuration opcodes with 0x40 over the wired values, and the
    battery query is no exception: the wired 0x92 is silent on the receiver while 0xD2 is
    acknowledged, so 00 d2 ... is the request and a report echoing d2 comes back
  * the level byte holds the charging flag in bit 7 and a step value below it: 1..21 on the
    21-step scale these mice use, or a direct percentage above 21, as steel-mouse decodes it
  * a level byte of 0 means the mouse is off or asleep, not empty, so it yields no reading
  * the 2.4 GHz link sleeps when the mouse is idle, and the acknowledgement only arrives
    while it is awake - the mouse wakes on the next movement, so a poll that lands on a
    sleeping mouse simply produces no reading

The Arctis Nova Pro Omni (base station 1038:2290) has a protocol of its own, with the
level of the spare battery charging in the base station next to the headset's: see
OMNI_MODELS further down.

New models go into MODELS (headsets on the b0 exchange), MOUSE_MODELS (mice),
CLASSIC_MODELS (headsets with a request of their own - the older Arctis and the Nova Pro
Wireless base stations) or OMNI_MODELS: product id -> (name, parser ...).

        dependably - "the luck of the draw" without it), so filtering on interface 3 skips
        that mouse altogether. When the page appears more than once, the collection on
        interface 3 wins, which is where the Nova headsets and the Rival 3 have it, so their
        path is unchanged.
