# Changelog

All notable changes to Halo Battery are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Omni (base station 1038:2290): the headset's battery, and the
  level of the spare battery charging in the base station, shown in the tooltip
  ("Arctis Nova Pro Omni: 75%, spare battery 50%"). Request `01 b0` on interface 3, layout
  from loteran/Arctis-Sound-Manager. With the base station switch on USB-2 or XBOX nothing
  can be read, and the diagnostics say which position it is in. Not tested on hardware.
- Finalmouse UltralightX (ULX) on its 2.4 GHz dongle (361D:0100), with the protocol of
  Finalmouse's XPanel: battery (state of charge, or the voltage on firmware that does not
  report it), charging, and whether the mouse is linked. A mouse that is off or asleep keeps
  its last level on a greyed icon. Not tested on hardware.
- A provider can add a line to a device's tooltip (`DeviceStatus.extra`).
- SteelSeries: older and other Arctis headsets. Not tested on these headsets; the raw
  replies go to the diagnostics.
  - On the `b0` exchange (interface 3): Arctis Nova 7P, Nova 3P / 3X Wireless,
    Arctis 7+ (and the PS5 / Xbox / Destiny editions), Arctis GameBuds.
  - With their own requests: Arctis 1 Wireless / 7X / 7P (`06 12`), Arctis 7
    (`06 14` then `06 18`), Arctis Pro Wireless 2019 (`06 18`), Arctis 9 (`00 20`),
    Arctis Pro Wireless (`41 aa` then `40 aa`).
  - Model list and layouts from HeadsetControl; the echo checks and the Arctis 7
    connection query from the Linux driver `hid-steelseries-arctis.c`. A reply that
    does not answer the request is never read as a level. Only vendor collections get
    a request. The Arctis Pro GameDAC is left out, because it is a wired headset.

### Fixed
- Arctis Nova 7: while the headset is off or still switching on, the dongle repeats
  the last battery level. The app showed that old level as live for a few seconds.
  The link byte (byte 1: 03 = connected, 02 = not connected) is now checked too.
  Verified on a real Nova 7 (22A1).
- SteelSeries: the Nova headsets are read only from their 0xFFC0 collection, not from
  whatever collection comes first on interface 3.
- Razer: the model table now has every wireless mouse whose battery OpenRazer reads, with
  OpenRazer's transaction id: for example the Pro Click V2 Vertical Edition (#58), Pro Click V2,
  Pro Click (Mini), Naga V2 Pro, Naga V2 HyperSpeed, Viper V3 HyperSpeed, Viper Mini SE,
  DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed, Basilisk Mobile, Orochi V2, Atheris and the older Mamba / Lancehead
  mice. Before, a mouse without "wireless" or "HyperSpeed" in its name was skipped.
  `tests/test_razer.py` checks the table against a copy of OpenRazer's list.

### Fixed
- Razer: PIDs 008F / 0090 are the Naga Pro, not the Naga V2 Pro (OpenRazer). The Naga V2 Pro
  (00A7 / 00A8) was missing and was skipped.
- Razer: the Basilisk X HyperSpeed (0083) is asked with transaction id 0xFF first, as in
  OpenRazer, not 0x1F.
- Razer: PID 0078 is the wired Razer Viper, which has no battery. It was in the table as a
  "Viper Ultimate" and got battery requests. The Viper Ultimate is 007A / 007B.
- Razer Barracuda Pro (2.4 GHz) support through its receiver (1532:053a), which does not
  answer the standard Razer request: the headset speaks the "PA" protocol, decoded from a
  USBPcap capture of Razer Synapse on a real unit. Battery command 0x21, charging 0x2A, and
  the `razer` provider hands this PID over instead of reporting "no reply" for it.
  Confirmed on hardware by @phl23 in
  [#10](https://github.com/HeyOkay/HaloBattery/issues/10): the level tracks (34% while the
  capture was taken, 27% when the branch was tested), the charging state follows the
  charger, and a switched-off headset reports "no link" instead of a stale value.
### Fixed
- **SteelSeries Rival 3 Wireless replies are read in either layout.** flozz/rivalcfg sends the same `aa 01` request and reads the reply with the same hidapi call, but takes a 3-byte reply with the level in byte 0 and charging in byte 2, while yurtemre7/steel-mouse reads an `aa` echo with the level in byte 1 and charging in byte 3. Nothing has been on hardware here, so both are accepted now instead of only the echo shape - a reply without the echo used to be skipped, which would have left the mouse showing nothing if rivalcfg is the correct one. The diagnostics print the raw reply and name the shape. The discrepancy was reported by @ahmedkhursheed23 in [#5](https://github.com/HeyOkay/HaloBattery/issues/5).
- **SteelSeries devices are found by usage page, not by interface number.** The configuration collection is `0xFFC0`, and the Rival 650 exposes it on interface 0 (rivalcfg's profile says endpoint 0, and rivalcfg issue #202 is about needing the usage page to find it dependably). Filtering on interface 3 skipped that mouse entirely. When the page appears more than once the collection on interface 3 wins, so the Nova headsets and the Rival 3 are read exactly as before. Pointed out by @ahmedkhursheed23 in [#5](https://github.com/HeyOkay/HaloBattery/issues/5).
- **Keyboards were drawn with a mouse pictogram.** Both providers report
  `kind="keyboard"` for the keyboards they support (Logitech HID++ over a receiver, and
  anything Bluetooth whose class says keyboard), but the badge list did not know the
  kind: a Logitech keyboard fell through to the mouse badge, and a Bluetooth one to the
  Bluetooth badge. There is a keyboard pictogram now, wide and low enough to read
  against the mouse at 16 px.
- **A short device name could hide an unrelated Bluetooth device.** The duplicate check
  accepted a match whenever the Bluetooth name was at least six characters and contained
  the HID name (or vice versa), without looking at the second name's length, so an HID
  device named "Razer" dropped a Bluetooth "Razer Barracuda Pro" and an HID "G Pro"
  dropped a "Logitech G Pro X Wireless". Both names now have to be at least six
  characters for a substring match; identical names still match as before.
- A wired Xbox-compatible controller could show **5%** while on the cable: `BatteryLevel`
  is documented as valid only for wireless devices, and a wired pad's byte is whatever the
  driver left in the field, so it is no longer read as a level (the last wireless reading
  is still kept, and a pad with none says full).
- With two Xbox-compatible controllers, one could take the *other* controller's level and
  name: `RawGameControllers` was indexed by slot number, but it is not the XInput slot list
  - it also holds controllers XInput cannot see (a DualSense, a wheel) whose order is not
  the slot order. Only the vendors this provider reads are considered now, and the reports
  are paired with the slots only when the two counts agree; otherwise the coarse XInput
  level is used instead of another controller's report.
- A controller connected over Bluetooth could appear twice - its XInput icon plus the
  Windows Bluetooth one - whenever Windows.Gaming.Input returned no report. The transport
  is now also derived from the HID device paths, which cannot mistake a 2.4 GHz receiver
  for a Bluetooth link because such a receiver also exposes a non-Bluetooth interface. A
  game controller of these vendors on a Bluetooth path counts on its own, so another device
  of the same vendor on USB - a Microsoft mouse or keyboard - no longer switches that
  detection off for Xbox pads.
- Windows.Gaming.Input is now asked only for controllers Windows can hand out as a
  **Gamepad**. `RawGameControllers` lists wheels, flight sticks and other controllers XInput
  cannot see as well, and they were being matched against the XInput slots they do not have.
- A controller that Windows.Gaming.Input cannot place on Bluetooth, because its device path
  carries no Bluetooth service guid, still showed a second icon: "Xbox controller: 10%" (the
  unusable remain=100 against full=1000) next to the correct "Xbox Wireless Controller: 77%"
  from Windows' own Bluetooth battery. A Bluetooth gamepad of the same device family now
  counts as the same device, compared exactly so the "Xbox controller 1"/"Xbox controller 2"
  names of two controllers cannot collapse into one icon. Reported by a reader on Reddit.
- **The MCHOSE G7 request goes only to the G7.** `0xA8A5` is a chip maker's vendor id
  ("YJX-CHIP") rather than a model, so other devices can sit behind it - and the G7's output
  report was written to the `0xFF01` collection of any of them. `G7_PID` was defined but never
  checked. Devices on that vendor id that are not the G7 are now left alone completely.
- **The Audeze sequence goes only to known Maxwells, and only to a vendor collection.** The 14
  packets were written to any device with vendor `0x3329` (`KNOWN` was only used to pick the
  display name), and on a device that has no `0xFF13` collection they went to *every* collection
  it exposes, including the consumer-control and telephony pages that answer nothing at all.
  Only the product ids in `KNOWN` are talked to now, and the sequence only ever goes to a vendor
  collection; a known Maxwell without one gets an icon and nothing is written to it.
- **The Audeze docstring no longer claims the sequence writes nothing.** It said the byte that
  marks a write (`0x00` or `0x82`) never appears in the sequence, but the seventh packet -
  `06 07 00 05 5A 03 00 07 1C` - has `0x00` there. That packet is HeadsetControl's own, byte for
  byte (`lib/devices/audeze_maxwell.hpp`, `UNIQUE_REQUESTS`), so either that byte is not a
  read/write marker or that packet is not a plain read: the claim was asserted rather than
  measured and is withdrawn. Reported by @ahmedkhursheed23 in
- **Two Logitech receivers of the same kind** (any two Unifying receivers share
  `0xC52B`, and Lightspeed receivers share ids too) were merged into one group, so the
  second receiver's interface paths overwrote the first one's and the devices paired to
  the first receiver were never read. Receivers are now grouped by product id *and*
  device instance, which the HID path carries; two receivers of the same kind say which
  one they are in the diagnostics, and their devices get keys of their own. A single
  receiver keeps the plain keys, so existing icons do not move.
- **The receiver instance key stops short of the collection number.** One interface numbers
  its collections in the last part of that path segment (`Col01` ends in `&0000`, `Col02` in
  `&0001`), so keeping the whole segment split a single receiver into two groups: the group
  holding only the long-report collection was polled without the short-report one, the empty
  slots' error reports could therefore never be read, every slot burnt its full timeout and
  was then pinged with the short one ever after - about 11 s for the first poll and 3.3 s for
  each one after, on a receiver with a single paired mouse, with slots 2-6 wrongly reported
  as "no answer (asleep or off)". Reported by @ahmedkhursheed23 with hardware measurements,
  and reproduced here on a `046D:C539` receiver: 11.08 s -> 1.06 s and 3.33 s -> 0.34 s.
  The rest of the segment comes from the interface, so two receivers still differ.
- **The module compiles without an invalid-escape warning.** The `_instance` docstring shows
  a Windows device path and was not a raw string, so Python 3.12 warned about `\H`.
- The PlayStation provider waited out its full 1.5 s window on *every* collection a
  controller exposes, so a DualShock 4 or DualSense that answered on none of its audio,
  touch or sensor collections held the poll loop for up to 6 s and delayed every other
  device's update behind it (measured: 6.0 s with four silent collections, 4.5 s when
  the gamepad collection was listed third). The gamepad collection - the one that
  carries the battery - is now tried first, and one controller may cost the poll at most
  2.5 s in total, after which the remaining collections are skipped and the diagnostics
  say so.
- A controller that is connected but whose battery can never be read - another app such as
  DS4Windows or HidHide holding the device, so every attempt to open it fails - kept the app's
  fast re-check running indefinitely: that path shortens the poll interval for *every* provider
  to 3 s, not just this one, so it never got cheaper. The fast path is now given up 120 s after
  a reading first goes missing, with the reason in the diagnostics; the icon stays, the poll
  cost does not.
- **A DualShock 4 wireless adapter with no controller on it no longer shows a 0% icon.** The
  adapter (`054C:0BA0`) streams report `01` whether or not a controller is paired with it, and
  fills the battery field with zeros in that case - which was read as a real 0% reading, and at
  0% the app also raises its low-battery alert, for a controller that is not there. Bit 2 of
  `status[1]` is the adapter's "no controller connected" flag: the Linux driver calls it
  `DS4_STATUS1_DONGLE_STATE` and treats it as not connected (`hid-playstation.c`; `hid-sony.c`
  has no DualShock 4 or dongle code any more). The adapter is now left without a reading when
  that bit is set, and the diagnostics say so. Reported by @ahmedkhursheed23 in
  [#62](https://github.com/HeyOkay/HaloBattery/issues/62).

## [1.11.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added
- **Update check**: once a day the app asks GitHub for the latest release. When a newer
  one is out, a notification says so once, and the tray menu gets a "Download vX.Y.Z…"
  item that opens the release page. Nothing is downloaded or installed automatically,
  and "Check for updates" in the menu turns it off (#14).
- Sony DualShock 4 and DualSense / DualSense Edge over USB and Bluetooth, read straight
  from the controller's HID input report (the same source as the Linux drivers and
  DS4Windows): exact level and charging state. A controller on the cable and on
  Bluetooth at once keeps one icon. Thanks to @dendr203 (#7).
- HyperX Cloud II Wireless over HID (`03F0:0696`, `03F0:018B`): battery and charging, using the exchange HeadsetControl documents for these product ids. **Unverified** - no Cloud II Wireless was on hand, so a reply that does not echo the command is ignored and a level above 100 refused rather than shown
- SteelSeries Rival 3 Wireless (`1038:1830`) over HID: battery and charging on the mouse exchange, next to the existing Nova headsets and alongside SteelSeries GG. **Unverified** - the reply layout is the open question in [#5](https://github.com/HeyOkay/HaloBattery/issues/5), so a reply without the command echo is skipped and a level above 100 refused rather than shown
- JBL Quantum 910 Wireless support through its dongle: the headset pushes report 0x08
  with the level in byte 1, the pattern plugato/JBL_Baterry_Monitor confirmed on this
  USB id (0ECB:2088, one vendor collection `ff13:0001`, interface 5 on a real unit). There is no request to send, and the headset can
  stay quiet for long stretches, so the last level heard is kept and shown greyed out.
  Confirmed on a real unit: the provider finds the receiver, matches its collection and shows the level,
  and a capture from that unit reads `08 5f 03 ...` - report 0x08 with byte 1 = `0x5f` = 95%, at the
  moment JBL's own app showed 95%. The report is an event: it arrives when the headset is plugged into
  its charger, and pressing buttons or the volume rocker does not produce it, so the listen window is ten
  seconds and the last level heard is kept. The receiver also pushes a power report 0x09 (byte 1 is 0x00
  when the headset is off and 0x01 when it is on, confirmed on a real unit) and a 0x02 frame; none of them
  is a level, and a headset last seen switched off explains itself in the diagnostics. The report has no charging flag, so none is shown.
- Logitech support over HID++ 2.0, without G HUB (and alongside it). Every device
  paired to a Lightspeed or Unifying receiver gets its own icon, named as the device
  reports itself; the level comes from the unified battery, battery status or battery
  voltage feature, whichever the device has. The icon follows the device's unit id, so
  two identical mice get two icons and a mouse keeps its icon between the receiver and
  the cable. Tested on the G502 LIGHTSPEED (voltage, matches G HUB) and the G502 X PLUS
  (unified battery); other HID++ 2.0 mice and keyboards should work the same way.
  A dozing radio takes up to half a second to answer, so the first request waits up
  to 2 s; once a paired device stops answering (asleep or switched off) it is only
  pinged briefly until it answers again, and keeps its last level, greyed out, for
  5 minutes.
- SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 support through its 2.4 GHz dongle, without SteelSeries GG
  (and alongside it): exact level and charging state. The other Arctis Nova 7 / 7X /
  7x variants and the Arctis Nova 5 / 5X are included from HeadsetControl's device
  list but not tested; new models with the same protocol are one line in
  `providers/steelseries.py`.
- Audeze Maxwell support, over the 2.4 GHz dongle (3329:4B19) and the USB-C cable
  (3329:4B1A), reading the vendor collection (usage page 0xFF13) with the sequence
  HeadsetControl uses: no Audeze HQ needed, and it works alongside it. The battery is
  attribute 0x0CD6, so the level is read as an attribute rather than hunted as an
  offset. Dongle and cable are one headset and share one icon, keyed on the serial
  number they report, so plugging in the cable does not make the icon disappear and
  come back. The Maxwell counts as a headset, so its icon gets the headset pictogram.
- Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro (1532:00BF) confirmed on hardware, listed in the README's
  table: transaction id 0x1F, command class 0x07, command 0x80 answers
  `02 1f 00 00 00 02 07 80 00 ab`, raw 0xAB = 171/255 = 67%, stable across polls and
  unchanged while Razer Synapse runs.
- MCHOSE M7 Ultra (5253:1020) over the 2.4 GHz receiver, on the vendor collection
  (usage page 0xFF01, whose sibling 0xFF0B never answers): feature report 0x11 (the shorter
  report, tried first) or 0x12 with command 0x06, every payload byte inverted, which returns
  `53 52 31 00 02 05 07 00 09 64 00 64` (vid, model, firmware, flags, level, charging).
  The request has to be repeated for every read, and the receiver only relays a real
  value while the mouse is awake - asleep it answers with zeros, so a silent mouse keeps
  its last level on a greyed icon, the same as an idle Razer mouse. On the cable the mouse
  answers on its own PID (5253:0031) with the charging byte set to 1 while the receiver
  goes quiet, and the two connections still share one icon.
- MCHOSE G7 (A8A5:2255, chip 'YJX-CHIP'), which is a different chip and a different
  protocol from the M7 Ultra: a 65-byte output report `00 55 30 A5 0B 2E 01 01 01`,
  answered by an input report starting `AA 30` with the level at byte 8 and the charging
  flag at byte 9. Implemented from @kek353's monitor and the device dump in #8 and
  **confirmed on their G7**: it answers `aa 30 a5 0b 0a 01 01 01 2e 00 00 00`, byte 8 =
  0x2E = 46% and byte 9 = 0 on the dongle, the same level their own tool shows. On its cable
  the same 0xFF01 read answers with the same level and the PID unchanged (`aa 30 a5 3c 0a 01
  01 01 2e 01 00 00`, byte 9 = 1 while charging), so a G7 keeps one icon either way; only the
  `AA 30` header is relied on, since byte 3 differs between dongle (`0x0b`) and cable (`0x3c`).
  A level out of range is still refused rather than reported as a made-up number. It gets an icon
  of its own, so it and an M7 Ultra on the same machine do not fight over one.
- MCHOSE A7 V2 Ultra (3837:100B), which is the same protocol as the M7 Ultra on MCHOSE's
  newer vendor id: the reference driver treats both identically and matches on the vendor
  id plus the vendor collection rather than by model list, which is what this provider
  does too. Its status read is documented on the shorter 0x11 report, so both report ids
  are tried, and a model the name table does not know is named from the receiver's own
  product string. **Unverified** - from the diagnostics in #4, no device here - and it
  gets an icon of its own, so it and an M7 Ultra on one machine stay two icons.

### Changed
- Audeze: the poll sends one packet instead of twenty. The packet that asks for
  attribute 0x0CD6 comes back with the marker on its own, on the dongle and on the
  USB-C endpoint alike: 0.19 s against 1.48 s. Both ran against each other every 30 s
  through a charge from 85% to 91% and agreed in 19 of 20 cycles, the one difference
  being the long sequence reading an older copy out of the device's rolling buffer.
  The full sequence stays as the fallback for a firmware that only reports after the
  initialisation.
- Audeze: charging is inferred from the cable endpoint answering, because the protocol
  carries no charging flag. Verified by diffing every record the headset returns while
  charging and while running off the dongle: identical apart from the echo of the query
  that was just sent. Docked and already full the icon still breathes where the LED is
  solid green, which is the trade for not telling someone to charge a headset that is
  plugged in.
- Razer: a sleeping mouse now keeps its last level on a greyed icon for five minutes
  instead of losing the icon after two failed polls (`STATUS_TIMEOUT`, "receiver
  present, device not responding"). That is what the README already described; the
  behaviour is gated so a switched-off headset still loses its icon.
- New controller pictogram for Xbox-compatible controllers (XInput and
  Windows.Gaming.Input), traced from the Xbox controller glyph: flat top, rounded
  shoulders, straight sides down to the grips, and the two sticks in the Xbox layout
  (left stick high, right stick low and nearer the middle). Nothing else is cut out,
  so it stays readable at 16 px.
- PlayStation controllers get a DualShock 4 pictogram in the same style: the outline
  with its stepped shoulder buttons and long grips, the touchpad and the two symmetric
  sticks cut out. The DualSense uses it too for now.
- HyperX: when the dongle has no 0xFF90:0x0303 collection, nothing is written to any
  other collection; the diagnostics list what the dongle offers instead.

### Fixed
- `--probe` now always lists every HID device it can see. The list was only printed when
  the poll found nothing at all, so on a machine whose other devices answered, a device
  that no provider sees - the case the list exists for - never appeared (found while
  answering #21).
- Razer mice that answer a battery request with somebody else's packet first are no
  longer written off as "off or asleep". Razer Synapse polls LED state on the same
  collection and its replies carry the same status byte as the battery reply, so the
  first packet could belong to a different command (seen on a DeathAdder V2 Pro in
  #3). The reply is now read on - bounded by the same deadline - until the answer to
  the request arrives, and a packet that is not that answer is never turned into a
  level, so a device that never answers still shows nothing rather than a number.
- After a device went missing (e.g. a Razer headset switched off while its receiver
  stays plugged in), all devices were polled every 3-4 seconds for as long as the app
  ran, instead of at the poll interval: the quick re-check that confirms a disconnect
  never stopped after the icon had been removed. Besides filling the log, this would
  keep waking wireless mice (e.g. Logitech) over the radio.
- A Razer device that is switched off while its receiver stays plugged in no longer
  writes the same six log lines on every poll: the failure is logged once, and again
  only when the reason changes or the device answers again.
- Bluetooth: a device that is also read over HID no longer gets a second icon from
  Windows' own Bluetooth battery API. A paired Maxwell reports the same level over both
  transports at once (90% over the cable endpoint and 90% over Bluetooth), so the
  Bluetooth copy is dropped and the HID reading - the device's own protocol, carrying
  the charging state - is kept. A device only Bluetooth can see keeps its Bluetooth
  icon, which is how a Maxwell used purely over Bluetooth is covered at all: the vendor
  collection the provider needs does not exist over Bluetooth. Game controllers are
  left out of this: for a controller on Bluetooth, Windows' own value is still the one
  shown, as in 1.10.1.
- Audeze: a switched-off headset no longer pays for the battery packet that cannot be
  answered (1.5 s per poll instead of 1.7 s), and its failure block is written once per
  outage instead of every poll.
- Audeze: a Maxwell that is switched off is no longer reported at the level it was
  on before. The dongle keeps answering with that value as if it were live (nine
  answers out of nine over two and a half minutes, all the same), so the dongle's
  own product string decides instead - "Audeze Maxwell Dongle" with no headset
  linked, "Audeze Maxwell HID" with one. Nothing is reported while it says Dongle,
  so the icon leaves the tray the way the README says a switched-off device does,
  and the 1.5 s battery sequence is not sent at all.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-09-26

### Added
- **Icon colour** in the tray menu: Automatic (as before), White or Black. For a
  transparent taskbar (e.g. TranslucentTB), where the Windows theme does not match
  what is behind the icons.
- README: the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro and Basilisk Ultimate, the FlyDigi Vader Pro
  controller, and Audio-Technica and JBL Tune 760NC Bluetooth headphones,
  confirmed working by users.

### Changed
- Releases are now a zip with a `HaloBattery` folder (`HaloBattery.exe` plus its
  libraries in `_internal`) instead of a single `HaloBattery.exe`. The single-file
  .exe unpacked Python into a temp folder at every start, which Windows Defender
  and other antivirus machine-learning heuristics flagged as a trojan by mistake
  (e.g. `Trojan:Win32/Sabsik.TE.A!ml`). The .exe now also carries version
  information (name, version, description) in its Properties, and is built
  without UPX compression. To update, replace the old `HaloBattery.exe` with the
  folder; "Start with Windows" is pointed at the new copy the first time it runs.
- "Windows Bluetooth devices" is now on by default for new installations, since
  many people use the app with Bluetooth headphones and controllers. Existing
  settings are kept: if the option was saved as off, it stays off.
- Bluetooth devices get a pictogram by their type instead of the Bluetooth rune:
  headphones and headsets the headset, mice the mouse, controllers the gamepad.
  The type comes from the device itself (the Bluetooth Class of Device, or the
  Appearance value for Bluetooth LE) or from its audio services; devices of other
  types, or whose type is unknown, keep the Bluetooth rune. Diagnostics show the
  detected type.

### Fixed
- An Xbox controller connected over Bluetooth showed up twice with "Windows
  Bluetooth devices" on: once as a Bluetooth device with the level Windows shows
  in Settings, and once as a controller with a wrong level (e.g. 10% instead of
  71%) and a generic "HID-compliant game controller" name. When the Bluetooth
  entry is there, the controller entry is now dropped; with Bluetooth devices
  turned off, it is shown without a level instead of the wrong one (over
  Bluetooth, Windows.Gaming.Input reported 100 of 1000 mWh for a controller at
  82%). Controllers named with a generic HID name are now called by their vendor
  ("Xbox controller") instead.
- Wired Razer devices without a battery (e.g. the Huntsman V2 keyboard) could show
  up as a tray icon: some of them answer the battery command too. Razer devices are
  now polled only when they are on the list of known wireless models or their name
  suggests a battery (HyperSpeed, wireless, receiver, dongle, dock, or a BlackShark,
  Barracuda or Nari headset). Skipped devices are still listed in the diagnostics.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added
- MyDockFinder support. MyDockFinder draws its own macOS-style menu bar and switches
  it between light and dark by the wallpaper or the full-screen app, while the Windows
  theme stays the same. While MyDockFinder is running, the icon colour now follows the
  same rule as its bar: when windows cover the whole area right under the bar
  (maximized, full-screen or snapped side by side), by their title bars (a thin strip
  at the top right of the screen is sampled; no cursor flicker, nothing is saved);
  as soon as the desktop shows anywhere under the bar, by the wallpaper as a whole,
  so a dark sky over a light landscape still counts as light. Shell overlays such as
  Task View, Snap Assist, Alt+Tab and the Start menu do not count as windows.
  The colour is re-checked the moment a window is maximized, restored, snapped,
  moved, minimized, closed or brought to the front (the same system window events
  MyDockFinder reacts to), again as the window animation settles, and every
  0.25 seconds otherwise; both colour variants of each icon are drawn in advance,
  so the icons switch together with the bar. The icons are black on a
  light bar and white on a dark one. With the standard Windows shell nothing changes:
  the icons follow the Windows theme as before.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed
- Possible USB keyboard dropouts while the app is running. To notice devices being
  plugged in or removed, the app listed all HID devices every 2.5 seconds through
  hidapi, which briefly opens every HID device on the system, the keyboard included;
  some high-polling-rate keyboards (e.g. NuPhy Air75 HE) may not tolerate that.
  - Plug and unplug detection now reads only the list of device paths from the
    Windows configuration manager and does not open any device.
  - The full device list is re-read only when a device is actually plugged in or
    removed, and only for the vendors the app supports (Razer, WLmouse, and the
    controller vendors used for naming); vendors that are not present are skipped.
  - Controller polls no longer read the product strings of every HID device.
- The icon of a device whose receiver was unplugged or that was switched off could
  stay for up to a minute: the second, confirming check waited for the next
  scheduled poll. It now runs 3 seconds after the first miss.
- Bluetooth devices took about a minute to appear after connecting and up to two
  minutes to disappear after disconnecting: they were checked by a new PowerShell
  run once a minute, and a disconnect had to be confirmed by the next run.
  One long-lived PowerShell process now checks only the connection state every
  2 seconds (a direct WinRT query by MAC address, no device scan) and reads the
  battery levels right after a device connects or disconnects, again at +3, +8 and
  +15 seconds (Windows reports the battery a moment after connecting) and once a
  minute. A connected device now shows up within a few seconds, and a disconnected
  one disappears in about 5 seconds (a disconnect is still confirmed once, so a
  momentary dropout does not hide the icon). If that process cannot run, the app
  falls back to the old once-a-minute check. The process exits together with the app.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- Xbox-compatible controllers, tested with the GameSir G7 Pro on its 2.4 GHz receiver.
  The battery is read through Windows.Gaming.Input (the API the Xbox Accessories app
  uses): an exact percentage and the charging state. XInput is used as a fallback;
  it only reports four levels, so the tooltip then shows an approximate value
  such as "about 55% (medium)".
- Gamepad pictogram: an Xbox controller silhouette with symmetric sticks.
- A controller's icon appears within a few seconds of switching it on and
  disappears within a few seconds of switching it off. Until Windows reports the
  battery, the icon is shown without an arc ("connected, battery level not reported yet").
- Automatic release builds: pushing a `v*` tag builds `HaloBattery.exe` on GitHub
  Actions and attaches it to the release. "Run workflow" builds it without releasing.
- The .exe has its own icon (a green ring on a dark disc), also used by `build_exe.bat`.

### Changed
- Devices that are switched off no longer stay in the tray as grey icons:
  - a Razer headset that is off while its receiver stays plugged in is hidden after
    two failed polls in a row;
  - a silent WLmouse keeps its greyed-out last level for 5 minutes (the receiver
    cannot tell a switched-off mouse from one that fell asleep) and is then hidden.
  Both come back as soon as the device answers again.
- The low battery notification says "battery is low" for devices that only report
  approximate levels, instead of an invented percentage.
- README: the supported devices table lists only hardware tested for real, and
  installation starts with the ready-made .exe.

### Fixed
- `--probe` no longer crashes on a cp1252 console when a device name contains
  non-ASCII characters.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-09-25

First public release.

### Added
- One tray icon per device: a battery ring with the device pictogram inside
  (headset, mouse or Bluetooth). The arc uses the taskbar colour, turns amber near
  the alert threshold and red at or below it; while charging it is green and slowly
  "breathes" (can be turned off).
- Razer BlackShark V2 Pro (2023) through the headset's own "PA" protocol, and the
  standard Razer HID battery command for the 2020 headset and wireless Razer mice.
  No Synapse required.
- WLmouse Beast X Max: receiver and USB cable share one icon; the cable wins while charging.
- Windows Bluetooth devices (optional): only devices connected right now are shown,
  using the WinRT connection status; the last known level covers polls where
  Windows omits it.
- Low battery notifications, poll interval and alert threshold settings, start
  with Windows, and a diagnostics report with raw protocol replies and recent log entries.
- Icons and the device list update within 2-3 seconds when a USB device is plugged
  in or unplugged.
- Settings and the autostart entry are migrated from the app's earlier name, Battery Tray.
